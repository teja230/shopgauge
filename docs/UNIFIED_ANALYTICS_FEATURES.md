# Unified Analytics & Predictions

This document describes the comprehensive unified analytics and prediction system implemented to transform the dashboard with enterprise-grade forecasting capabilities and accurate data visualization.

## Problem Statement

The original dashboard had several critical issues:

1. **Graph Mismatch**: RevenueChart only showed revenue data but legend claimed to show "Revenue", "Orders", and "Conversion Rate"
2. **Missing Data Aggregation**: Orders were individual records, not aggregated by day for proper visualization
3. **No Prediction Algorithm**: No forecasting functionality existed
4. **Poor Data Visualization**: Graphs didn't effectively show relationships between metrics

## Solution Overview

We implemented a comprehensive unified analytics system with enterprise-grade prediction capabilities that addresses all original issues while providing a robust, scalable foundation for future enhancements.

## Core Features

### 1. Unified Analytics Endpoint (`/api/analytics/unified-analytics`)

**Backend Implementation:**
- **File**: `backend/src/main/java/com/storesight/backend/controller/AnalyticsController.java`
- **Method**: `getUnifiedAnalytics()`
- Aggregates orders, revenue, and products data by day
- Calculates conversion rates per day
- Fills missing days with zero values for complete time series
- Supports configurable time periods (7-365 days)
- Implements advanced prediction algorithms

**Response Format:**
```json
{
  "historical": [
    {
      "date": "2024-01-01",
      "revenue": 1250.50,
      "orders_count": 15,
      "conversion_rate": 2.8,
      "avg_order_value": 83.37
    }
  ],
  "predictions": [
    {
      "date": "2024-02-01",
      "revenue": 1180.25,
      "orders_count": 14,
      "conversion_rate": 2.6,
      "avg_order_value": 84.30,
      "confidence_interval": {
        "revenue_min": 950.20,
        "revenue_max": 1410.30,
        "orders_min": 11,
        "orders_max": 17
      },
      "confidence_score": 0.85,
      "prediction_type": "forecast"
    }
  ],
  "period_days": 60,
  "total_revenue": 45250.75,
  "total_orders": 567
}
```

### 2. Advanced Prediction Algorithms

**Multiple Forecasting Models:**
- **Linear Regression**: Trend analysis for long-term patterns
